# Wrap
Wrap is a 2D platformer in which the world infinitely wraps around itself!
It has normal platformer controls, and the only thing to do is... Get to the end of the level!

## Known Bugs / Glitches
* The enemy collision detection (for killing them) sucks, but I'm too busy on other projects to fix it. :(
* The text resizing for when the canvas needs to resize is good, although sometimes the text is slightly too large, there is no way I will bother with that.
